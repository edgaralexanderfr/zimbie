# Zimbie

## Overview

Zimbie is an indie zombie-survival/crafting/tower-defense/TPS/simulation web-browser based game where you have to collect resources as water, food and supplies in order to survive a post-apocaliptic world.

Hide between the density of a *"lonely"*, *"desert"* and *"safe"* forest, create and customise your character, change its clothes and colours with a wide selection of stuff and accesories, create your house or shelter, protect it before it's too late, survive as many days as you can, craft weapons, collect ammo and prove you are the legend who kept the human specie alive till the last second.

## Development

### Getting started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm start`
3. Open *.vscode/typescript.code-snippets* and add your developer info there.

### Running Blender's Python script:

1. Install Python's PIP [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) **NOTE:** if you have **Blender** installed, you can make use of the Python installation that comes along with it and use it to install PIP and all dependencies, this has some pros and cons, like the reduction of possible errors due to the use of different Python versions, but if you install PIP and your dependencies within Blender's installation folder, you are exposed to lose your dependencies when you upgrade or install a newer version of Blender.
2. Install Pillow via PIP `pip install Pillow`
